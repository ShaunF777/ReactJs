    {
    id: 1,
    prompt:
      'To make a named variable or function available to other files you put a keyword before its declaration. Fill the single word keyword (example: "let", "const" are NOT correct):',
    answer: 'export',
    explanation:
      'Named exports use the export keyword before a declaration, e.g. export let apiKey = "..." ;'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    prompt:
      'To export a single default value from a file you use two words. Fill the two-word phrase exactly (lowercase, space separated):',
    answer: 'export default',
    explanation:
      'Default exports use export default value;. Only one default per file.'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    prompt:
      'When importing named exports you put the exported names inside these two characters. Type the two-character string (no spaces):',
    answer: '{}',
    explanation:
      'Named imports use curly braces: import { apiKey } from "./util.js";'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    prompt:
      'When importing a default export you do NOT use the characters from question 3. You import the default using a single identifier. Type the single word that is used in example: import ____ from "./util.js"; (the correct reply is the placeholder word used in the import statement):',
    answer: 'apiKey',
    explanation:
      'Default imports are written like: import apiKey from "./util.js"; You may name it anything.'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    prompt:
      'To import every named export from a module into one object you use this pattern: import * as ____ from "./util.js"; Fill the single identifier used as the aggregated object:',
    answer: 'utils',
    explanation:
      'import * as utils from "./util.js"; then access exports as utils.apiKey; default is utils.default.'
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    prompt:
      'To rename an imported binding when importing a named export you use a two-letter keyword between the original name and the local name. Type that keyword (lowercase):',
    answer: 'as',
    explanation:
      'Use import { abc as content } from "./util.js"; to alias abc to content locally.'
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    prompt:
      'In vanilla browser JavaScript you must include this attribute on the script tag to enable import/export. Fill the attribute value (exact string):',
    answer: 'module',
    explanation:
      'Use <script type="module" src="app.js"></script> so the browser treats the script as an ES module.'
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    prompt:
      'When importing from a plain .js file in vanilla JavaScript you typically must include this part of the path that is sometimes omitted in React builds. Fill the extension including the dot (example: .ts is NOT correct):',
    answer: '.js',
    explanation:
      'In vanilla JS you normally import with the extension: import { foo } from "./util.js"; build tools often let React omit it.'
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    prompt:
      'A single file can export both a default and multiple named exports. Type the word that must be unique (single allowed per file) when exporting the main export (one word):',
    answer: 'default',
    explanation:
      'Only one default export is allowed per file; named exports can be many.'
