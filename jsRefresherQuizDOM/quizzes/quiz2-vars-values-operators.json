    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "Which keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned?",
      "answer": "let",
      "explanation": "Use `let` to declare block-scoped variables that can be reassigned."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "prompt": "Which keyword declares a constant that must not be reassigned?",
      "answer": "const",
      "explanation": "`const` creates a constant binding. Attempting to reassign it will throw an error."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "prompt": "What are the three most common primitive value types in JavaScript? (clue: s,n,t)",
      "answer": "strings, numbers, booleans",
      "explanation": "JavaScript handles many values, but the most common primitives are strings, numbers, and booleans."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "prompt": "Which two special values indicate that a variable does not currently hold a value? (clue: n__ and un____ed)",
      "answer": "null and undefined",
      "explanation": "`null` and `undefined` represent the absence of a value in JavaScript."
    },

      "prompt": "What notation convention should be used for variable names in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "camelCase",

      "id": 8,
      "prompt": "Why are variables useful compared to directly writing values inline? (clue: NOT use and read, but...)",
      "answer": "reusability and readability",
      "explanation": "Variables allow reusing values and improve code readability by defining values once and referring to them by name."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "prompt": "Which four basic math operators are available in JavaScript? (clue: p, m, t, d)",
      "answer": "plus, minus, times, division",
      "explanation": "JavaScript supports + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division)."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "prompt": "Besides numbers, what else can the plus operator (+) be used for? (clue: Con___ s___s)",
      "answer": "concatenating strings",
      "explanation": "The + operator can join strings together, e.g. \"hello\" + \"world\" → \"helloworld\"."

    {
      "id": 12,
      "prompt": "Which operator checks for strict equality and returns a Boolean?",
      "answer": "===",
      "explanation": "The triple equal sign (`===`) checks for strict equality and yields true or false."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "prompt": "What type of value does a comparison operator (like ===, >, <) return?",
      "answer": "Boolean",
      "explanation": "Comparison operators return either true or false."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "prompt": "Which operators check for greater than, smaller than, greater or equal, and smaller or equal?",
      "answer": ">, <, >=, <=",
      "explanation": "These are the standard comparison operators used to compare values."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "prompt": "Which keyword is commonly used with comparison operators to execute code conditionally?",
      "answer": "if",
